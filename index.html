        A dedicated, passionate individual that has a strong background in customer service and communications.<br><br>

        During my undergraduate career, I was lucky enough to study at one of the most diverse universities in the nation. I was introduced to people of varying backgrounds, financial statuses, gender identities, and sexual orientations. I was provided numerous new opportunities to take on responsibility within my community. I joined a Greek organization, where I held multiple positions, and finally served on the executive board during my junior year. Concurrent with this position, I served another executive position within the Panhellenic organization at UCR. It was a daunting task; two positions, a full academic course load, and a part time job. I found myself pulled in every direction at all hours of the day, yet I felt as if I were fulfilling my true potential. I never lost sight of my determination to attend graduate school and someday earn my PhD. Regardless of my time-consuming extracurriculars, I was able to graduate a quarter early at UCR. This accomplishment was extremely rewarding, as I was able to hone my time management skills in a way that benefitted me and helped me reach my goals. I was friends with women who differed from me in terms of racial and financial backgrounds; geologically, socially, and personally, we could not have been less similar. I was ecstatic over the opportunity to live with these women, who changed my perspective on life and education. They became my dearest friends, and always encouraged me to reach for the stars. Thanks to their unique perspectives, I felt a strong desire to implement these ideas in my academic career. I delved deeper into studying feminism literature and gender theory in conjunction with American literature, which sparked the emphasis for my graduate degree. I looked forward to my English lectures everyday, as the rich ideas and perspectives shared always made me consider my own background and personal bias. I fell in love with the varying analyses of literary pieces, and the millions of different ways they could be interpreted. 
	Throughout my teenage years, I struggled to find a purpose in life. It was hard for me to align with my peers, who focused their desires around “getting rich” as quickly and as easily as possible. My one true love was always English; the passion I felt for this facet of study was unmatched by any other discipline. My dedication to this subject carried me through my undergraduate career; no matter how busy I was, it was worth it for the chance to pursue higher education in this field. Everyone who knew me knows I am a literature fanatic, and doing work in this subject doesn’t feel like work at all. It feels as if I am fulfilling my higher calling. Nearly everyday I thank my mother everyday for instilling the belief that dedication is the greatest skill one can hold. The awards I have received for my commitment to various positions I have held resonate one truthful reminder: hard work pays off. The pursuit of knowledge equates to my pursuit of a higher education, and I am looking forward to every step on the way.
